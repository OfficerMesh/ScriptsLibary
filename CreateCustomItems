Tool Setup
[+] You need to make a tool in RBLXStudio or use a free model.
[+] Cant be a model or a part, needs to be a tool.
[+] Replace ItemName with your tools name.


Animation Setup
For animation you need to setup a idle animation and put it in a folder named Animations

If you are lazy to make your own, I'll give you one.

Putting Animation In 
Only works if you are making your own item or modifying a tool to make another item
Get the Animation Folder I put and put it in the Tool and done.
Then Publish it and  RBXASSERID://your tool id
